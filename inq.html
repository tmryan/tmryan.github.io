                <p>I am passionate about games and I love solving problems, so it made sense to me that a game engine was the obvious choice for a large-ish summer coding project. It started off as a small UI test but the more I work on inQ, the more things I want to implement. I'm having a lot of fun learning and creating with this one. So, even though I need to focus on school this semester, I'll be back. I'm also working on getting a wiki up and running to document the project. I will update this page with a link as soon as I am able.</p>
                 <p>The info below isn't an overview of the entire project, but it serves as a brief description of some of its systems. If you would like to see what was completed over the summer, please download the inQ_Test.zip from the inQ GitHub repository. If you value your time and would rather get it here instead, click the Demo button below.</p>

            <h2>Screenshots & Info</h2>
            <ul class="list-inline">
                <p>GRAPHICS</p> 
                <li><img src="./img/inq_graphics.jpg"></img></li>
                <p></br>inQ currently uses Java and its AWT graphics API for rendering. The main graphics class extends a JFrame with repaint disabled so AWT and Swing will play nice. The graphics class also has a Canvas, with a double buffered BufferStrategy, which serves as the front and back buffer. At the start of each render call, a compatible BufferedImage is created and delegated to all of the inQ view components; this creates a composite image of the scene which is then clipped to the size of a camera object's viewport.</p>
                <p>Right now there is a large bottleneck during render time. I am still investigating, but I think it might be transparency related. In the future I plan to implement some sort of threaded scene builder, procedurally split the scene and its actors up into tiles either in the editor or during load time, and implement the renderer using OpenGL instead of AWT.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul class="list-inline">
                <p></br>PATHING & MOVERS</p>
                <li><img src="./img/inq_pathingMap.jpg"></img></li>
                <p></br>The pathing system in inQ is implemented with a matrix of pathing cells, with each cell having an enum signifying its pathing type. As collidable actors move through the game space, their mover system checks the scene state's pathing map to see if nearby cells allow that mover's pathing type. Movement involves a mover system which is attached to a moveable actor, and mover modules which can be attached to the moversystem. The current scene state issues movement commands (i.e. walk, jump, etc.) to the actor state which delegates to the mover system.</p>
                <p>I think these systems could use some redesign, but right now the biggest problem is that jumping and jumping while moving don't function well. Once there is time, I'll implement some rules for maintaining the actor's current momentum while jumping and falling, and play around with designing a simple physics system. It's a big undertaking but it sounds like fun.</p>

            </ul>
            <ul class="list-inline">
                <p><br>INTERACTIVE OBJECTS & GAME EVENTS</p>
                <li><img src="./img/inq_clicky.jpg"></img></li>
                <p></br>Interactive objects mainly consist of subclassed actor and actor state objects. They may have additional attributes such as fading and highlighting, both of which can be disabled, and can have a game event added to them using an attach method. Game events are the basic implementation of what will eventually become the scripting system, and currently come wrapped in one of two triggers: timed event and area trigger.</p>
            <p>I'm kind of a sucker for modularity and I try my best to implement everything so that it can be customized up to an extent. For instance, you can create an interactive object with an attached trigger area, give it a game event that tells it to fade, then have a fading wall like the one in the inQ_Test program.</p>
